  ## No experience necessary

  Harvesting grapes is an ancient process, and is perhaps the most critical step
  in wine-making.  But the process is easily learned. With only a few minutes
  instruction, we will leave you to your own to collect your own superb wine
  grapes.

  We welcome all comers, from those with no experience to seasoned vintners. 
  You are welcome to bring your own equipment, or come empty-handed and we will
  give you everything you need to collect and deliver your own harvest.

## We tend our vines all year long.
## Now it's **your turn to harvest**.

Since 2005, we have tended to our two acres of grape vines with responsible stewardship of plants, crops, and land.  

After many years or harvesting our own vines, we now invite you to participate in this unique experience.  

Best of all, you can buy what you pick for as little as one dollar per pound, and turn your efforts into a bottle of wine you'll remember forever.
