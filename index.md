  ## No experience necessary


  Growing and harvesting grapes is an ancient process, perhaps the most crucial
  in the wine making process.  "Great wine begins in the vineyard," is a phrase
  that dates back to antiquity.  Our vines have a noble heritage and a promising
  future.  We have been growing for the commercial trade since 2005 and now we
  invite everyone with an interest in making wine from fine grapes to join our
  harvest.



  We welcome all comers,  so if you are trying out your first crush or you have
  done it for years, come and join us.  You are welcome to bring your own
  equipment, or come empty-handed and we will give you everything you need to
  collect and deliver your own harvest.

## We tend our vines all year long.

## Now it's **your turn to harvest**.

Since 2005, we have tended to our two acres of grape vines with responsible stewardship of plants, crops, and land.  Our grapes have gone into a number of interesting and innovative vintages.

And while we will continue to sell most of our harvest to commercial wineries, we now invite all our wine-making friends to participate in this unique experience.  

Best of all, you can buy what you pick for as little as one dollar per pound, and turn your efforts into a bottle of wine you'll remember forever.
