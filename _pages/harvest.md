## Spend a day at Black Dog Vineyard!

It's fun. It's easy. It's great to be outdoors in a vineyard full of lush, ripe grapes. Bring your own equipment or use ours.  We have dozens of pruners and hundreds of lugs.  You pick and we'll weigh.



But while you're at it, why don't you make a day of it. Bring a picnic lunch, maybe even a bottle of wine.  Let the kids play in the 6 acre lawn. Black Dog Vineyard is a beautiful piece of Hoosier countryside with woods, water and all kinds of critters.  Why, you might even meet the famous black dogs themselves.
